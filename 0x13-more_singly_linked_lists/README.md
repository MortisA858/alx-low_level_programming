0. Print list
Explanation:

#include <stdio.h>
#include "lists.h"

stdio.h is included for using the printf function, and lists.h is included for the definition of the listint_t structure.

size_t print_listint(const listint_t *h)
{
    size_t count = 0;
The print_listint function is defined to take a pointer h to the head of a listint_t list as an argument, and returns the number of nodes in the list as a size_t value. The count variable is declared and initialized to 0, to keep track of the number of nodes in the list.

    while (h)
    {
        printf("%d\n", h->n);
The while loop is used to iterate over the linked list. The loop continues as long as h is not NULL. On each iteration of the loop, the value of the current node is printed using the printf function. The %d format specifier is used to print the integer value of h->n. The \n character is used to print a newline after the value, to format the output as expected.

        h = h->next;
        count++;
    }
After printing the value of the current node, the h pointer is updated to point to the next node in the list by assigning h->next to h. The count variable is incremented to keep track of the number of nodes processed so far.

    return (count);
}
Finally, the count variable is returned as the result of the function, indicating the number of nodes in the list.



1. List length
Explanation:
The function listint_len takes a pointer to a linked list as an argument (const listint_t *h), and it returns the length of the linked list.

The variable count is used to keep track of the length of the linked list. It is initialized to 0.

The variable current is used to iterate through the linked list. It is initialized to h (the head of the linked list).

The while loop will continue to execute as long as current is not equal to NULL.

In each iteration of the loop, the value of count is incremented by 1.

The value of current is updated to the next node in the linked list by assigning it to current->next.

Finally, the function returns the value of count, which is the length of the linked list.



2. Add node
Explanation:
This function adds a new node to the beginning of a linked list.

The function first allocates memory for a new node using the malloc function and checks if it was successful by checking if the returned pointer is NULL.
If the memory allocation was not successful, the function returns NULL.
If the memory allocation was successful, the function assigns the value of n to the n field of the new node.
The next field of the new node is assigned the current head of the linked list *head.
The head of the linked list is then updated to the newly created node.
The function finally returns the address of the newly created node.



3. Add node at the end
Explanation:
This function add_nodeint_end is used to add a new node at the end of a linked list. Here is what it does line by line:

struct listint_s *new_node, *temp;: declares two pointers of type listint_t named new_node and temp.

new_node = malloc(sizeof(listint_t));: creates a new node of type listint_t by allocating memory to the new_node pointer.

if (new_node == NULL): checks if the new_node is NULL, which means the memory allocation failed.

{return (NULL);}: returns NULL in case of memory allocation failure.

new_node->n = n;: assigns the argument n to the field n of the newly created node.

new_node->next = NULL;: sets the next field of the newly created node to NULL, since it is going to be the last node of the linked list.

if (*head == NULL): checks if the head of the linked list is NULL.

{*head = new_node;}: sets the head of the linked list to the newly created node if it was NULL.

else: if the head of the linked list is not NULL.

{temp = *head;: sets temp to the head of the linked list.

while (temp->next != NULL): iterates through the linked list until the last node is reached.

temp = temp->next;: sets temp to the next node in the linked list.

temp->next = new_node;: sets the next field of the last node to the newly created node.

return (new_node);: returns the newly created node.



4. Free list
Explanation:

The function takes a pointer head to the first node in a linked list of type listint_t.

A temporary pointer temp is declared and initialized to head.
The while loop runs as long as head is not equal to NULL.

Within the loop, temp is set to head, head is set to head->next (which points to the next node in the list).

The memory pointed to by temp is freed using the free function.

The loop continues to run, freeing each node in the list, until head becomes NULL.



5. Free
Explanation:

#include "lists.h" is a preprocessor directive to include the header file lists.h in the program. This header file contains the definition of the data structure listint_t and any other required type or constant definitions for the linked list.

The next line is a block comment that describes the purpose of the function and the arguments it takes. The @head argument is a double pointer to the head of the list.

The line void free_listint2(listint_t **head) declares the function free_listint2 and takes a double pointer head as its argument.

The line if (head == NULL) return; checks if the double pointer head is NULL. If it is, the function immediately returns without doing anything. This is to prevent accessing NULL pointers.

The line listint_t *temp; declares a pointer temp of type listint_t.

The while loop starts with the condition *head != NULL. The loop continues as long as the value pointed to by *head is not NULL.

Within the loop, the line temp = *head; sets temp to the value pointed to by *head.

The line *head = (*head)->next; updates the value pointed to by *head to the next node in the list.

The line free(temp); frees the memory pointed to by temp, which was the current node of the list.

The loop continues until the value pointed to by *head is NULL, at which point the function returns.



6. Pop
Explanation:

First, the function checks if the linked list is empty by checking if *head is NULL. If it is, the function returns 0.

If the linked list is not empty, the function declares a pointer temp to the current head node and a variable n to store the head node's data.

The function sets the value of *head to the next node in the linked list (i.e., temp->next), effectively deleting the current head node.

The function frees the memory occupied by the deleted head node by calling free(temp).

Finally, the function returns the value of n, which is the data of the deleted head node.



7. Get node at index
Explanation:

The function takes a pointer head to the first node of the linked list and an index as input.

The function declares a variable i to keep track of the current index, a pointer node to traverse the linked list, and sets it to head.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through the linked list. The loop continues as long as i is less than index and node is not NULL.

In each iteration, the function sets node to the next node in the linked list (node->next).

After the loop, if i is equal to index, the function returns node, which is the nth node.

If i is not equal to index, the function returns NULL, indicating that the node at the given index does not exist in the linked list.



8. Sum list
Explanation:

The function takes a pointer head to the first node of the linked list as input.

The function declares a variable sum to store the sum of all the data and a pointer node to traverse the linked list, and sets it to head.

The function uses a while loop to iterate through the linked list. The loop continues as long as node is not NULL.

In each iteration, the function adds the current node's data (node->n) to sum and sets node to the next node in the linked list (node->next).

After the loop, the function returns sum, which is the sum of all the data in the linked list. If the list is empty, sum will be 0.



9. Insert
Explanation:
This function takes as input a double pointer to the head of a linked list, an index idx, and a value n. It returns a pointer to the newly created node.

The function starts by checking if the head pointer is NULL. If it is, the function returns NULL. Then, it checks if the index is not 0. If it's not, the function traverses the linked list until it reaches the node at the idx - 1 position. If it reaches the end of the linked list without finding the node at the idx - 1 position, it returns NULL.

Next, the function creates a new node and assigns the value n to it. If the index is 0, the function updates the head of the linked list to point to the new node and sets the next pointer of the new node to the previous head. If the index is not 0, the function updates the next pointer of the node at the idx - 1 position to point to the new node and the next pointer of the new node to point to the node previously pointed to by the node at the idx - 1 position.

Finally, the function returns a pointer to the newly created node.



10. Delete at index
Explanation:

The function takes a pointer head to a pointer to the first node of the linked list, and an index (index of the node that should be deleted) as input.

The function checks if the linked list is empty, and returns -1 if it is.

The function declares a variable i to keep track of the current index, a pointer node to traverse the linked list, and a pointer temp to the node that will be deleted, and sets node to *head.

If the index of the node to be deleted is 0 (i.e., the head node), the function sets the head node to be the next node (*head = node->next), frees the memory occupied by the head node (free(node)), and returns 1 indicating success.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through the linked list until it reaches the node just before the desired index (index - 1). The loop continues as long as i is less than index - 1 and node->next is not NULL.

If node->next is NULL, the function returns -1 indicating that the node does not exist at the given index.

The function sets temp to the node that will be deleted (temp = node->next), sets the next node of the node just before the desired index to be the node that comes after the node to be deleted (node->next = temp->next), and frees the memory occupied by the node to be deleted (free(temp)).

The function returns 1 indicating success.



11. 
Explanation
This function reverse_listint is used to reverse a linked list. It takes in a double pointer to the head of the linked list, and returns a pointer to the head of the reversed linked list. The function uses three pointers prev, next, and head, which are initially set to NULL.

Check if the input head is NULL or the linked list is empty. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns NULL.

Check if the linked list has only one node. If so, the function returns the head.

The while loop iterates through the linked list until the head is NULL.

In each iteration of the while loop, the next pointer is set to the next node in the list.

The head node's next pointer is then set to prev, which is the previously reversed node.

prev is then set to head and head is set to next.

The while loop continues until all the nodes in the linked list have been reversed.

Finally, head is set to prev and the reversed linked list is returned.



12. Print (safe version)
Explanation:
Two pointers tmp_n and l_n are initialized to NULL, and two variables counter and new_n are initialized to 0.

tmp_n is set to the head of the list.

The first while loop starts by checking if tmp_n is not NULL. If it is not, it will enter the loop.

Within the loop, the value of the node that tmp_n is pointing to is printed with the address of the node, and counter is incremented by 1.

tmp_n is set to tmp_n->next, and l_n is set to the head of the list. new_n is reset to 0.

The second while loop starts by checking if new_n is less than counter. If it is, it will enter the loop.

Within the second loop, the function checks if tmp_n is equal to l_n. If they are equal, it means there is a loop in the linked list, and the value of the node that tmp_n is pointing to is printed with the address of the node.

If there is a loop in the linked list, the function returns counter.

If there is no loop in the linked list, l_n is set to l_n->next and new_n is incremented by 1.

The second while loop continues until new_n is not less than counter.

After the second loop, the function checks if the head of the list is NULL. If it is, the program exits with a status of 98.

The first while loop continues until tmp_n is NULL.

Finally, the function returns counter.



13. Free (safe version)
Explanation:
A function free_listint_safe is defined which takes a double pointer h to the head of the linked list as an argument. The function returns the size of the list that was freed.

A variable len is initialized to 0, a variable diff is declared, and a pointer temp is declared.

The function checks if h is NULL or *h (the head of the linked list) is NULL. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns 0.

The while loop starts by checking if *h is not NULL. If it is not, it will enter the loop.

Within the loop, the difference between *h and (*h)->next is calculated and stored in diff.

If diff is greater than 0, it means that the linked list is not a loop, so the next node in the linked list is assigned to temp. The current node that *h is pointing to is freed, *h is set to temp, and len is incremented by 1.

If diff is not greater than 0, it means that the linked list has a loop, so the current node that *h is pointing to is freed, *h is set to NULL, len is incremented by 1, and the loop is broken.

After the loop, *h is set to NULL.

Finally, the function returns len.



14. Find the Loop
Explanation:
The function find_listint_loop takes a pointer head to the head of the linked list as an argument and returns a pointer to the node that starts the loop.

Two pointers slow and fast are declared and initialized to head.

The function checks if head is NULL, and if it is, it returns NULL.

The while loop starts by checking if slow, fast, and fast->next are all not NULL. If they are not, the loop will enter.

Within the loop, fast moves two nodes forward in the linked list (to fast->next->next) while slow moves one node forward (to slow->next).

If fast and slow are equal, it means that there is a loop in the linked list.

In this case, slow is reset to head and the two pointers slow and fast move one node forward in the linked list at a time. The loop continues until slow and fast are equal. The node that they are both pointing to is the start of the loop, so it is returned.

If fast and slow are not equal, the loop continues until slow, fast, or fast->next is NULL.

If the loop finishes and fast and slow are still not equal, it means that there is no loop in the linked list, so NULL is returned.
